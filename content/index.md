## Mission

1. This website should cover all aspects of accessible design, from typography and images to futuristic assistive technology
2. The guidelines should never be complete; they should evolve with time ([open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/accessibilityguidelines.com))
3. For easy implementation, guidelines should be backed by code samples for the web

## Progress
