# About

The goal of this website is to help designers and developers build truly inclusive products. The source code is available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/accessibilityguidelines.com).

## The why

I've wanted to write my own style guide for a few years now. I usually adhere to the Chicago Manual of Style, but there are still some places where we end up disagreeing. Now that I work at [Oswald Labs](https://oswaldlabs.com), an accessibility technology company, I thought that it would be a great idea to write universal accessibiliy and design guidelines, which should be thorough yet easy to implement. I purchased the [accessibilityguidelines.com](https://accessibilityguidelines.com) domain in 2016 and started making a list of topics I want to write about, and wrote my first article three years later.

## The website

This website and all content is open-source, written by a community of developers. This website is built and maintained by [Anand Chowdhary](https://anandchowdhary.com), a creative technologist and entrepreneur with several years of experience in web accessibility.
