# 	Accessibility Guidelines Projects

I've wanted to write my own style guide since a few years. I usually adhere to the Chicago Manual of Style, but there are still some places where we end up disagreeing. Now that I work at [Oswald Foundation](https://oswald.foundation), an accessibility technology company, I thought that it would be a great idea to write universal accessibiliy and design guidelines, which should be thorough yet easy to implement.

### Mission
1. It should cover all aspects of web design, from typography to images to futuristic assistive technology.
2. It should never be *complete*, it should always be evolving (that's why Github is the perfect place for it.)
3. It should have code samples to make web implementation easy.
