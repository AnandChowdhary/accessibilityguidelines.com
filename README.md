> The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

We organize and sponsor startup events, hackathons, community meetups, educational competitions, and more. Our previous sponsorships include NESST and BharatHacks.

We also believe in open innovation and devote part of our time to contributing to open-source projects. Our projects include Staart and Staart UI, plug-and-play tech stack starers for SaaS startups written in TypeScript. We use it ourselves.
