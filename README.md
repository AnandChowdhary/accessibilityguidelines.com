# 	Accessibility Guidelines Projects

I've wanted to write my own style guide since a few years. I usually adhere to the Chicago Manual of Style, but there are still some places where we end up disagreeing. Now that I work at [Oswald Foundation](https://oswald.foundation), an accessibility technology company, I thought that it would be a great idea to write universal accessibiliy and design guidelines, which should be thorough yet easy to implement.

### Mission
1. It should cover all aspects of web design, from typography to images to futuristic assistive technology.
2. It should never be *complete*, it should always be evolving (that's why Github is the perfect place for it.)
3. It should have code samples to make web implementation easy.

## Progress

The first step is to make a list of topics we'd like to cover, and then links to articles and independent research/sources about each of them. Using all of this will we be able to write the guidelines. **Throw in a pull request to contribute.**

### Topics to Cover

- Text contrast ratios, sizes and weights, AA/AAA
- Link underlines, tooltips, focus states
- Alt text for images, accessible SVGs
- Color blindness, dyslexia, *Agastya* incorporation
- Using correct elements, eg. address, accessibility tree
- Keyboard navigation, “skip to content”
- ARIA attributes, SEO meta tags, etc.
- Semantic tags, eg. blockquote cite
- Adding speech synthesis to all content
- Translation?
